# Governance Engine

The single source of truth for RootCX's security and governance model. It specifies what the rules ARE at the level of structural guarantees. Operational policy (review cadences, MFA mandates, break-glass procedures) lives in `governance-plan.md`.

Where the current code diverges from this document, that is a conformance gap, not a change to the rules.

## PART 1 — THE MODEL

### Primitives (5 concepts, nothing else)

The entire model is built from exactly these:

| # | Primitive | What it is |
|---|-----------|------------|
| 1 | **Principal** | A named identity that can act. Exactly one of three kinds: human, agent, service account. |
| 2 | **Grant** | A principal's resolved permission set (roles unioned). Deny-by-default; starts at zero. |
| 3 | **Intersection** | The universal authority operator: `effective = grant(actor) ∩ perms(responsible principal) ∩ task scope`. Monotone non-increasing. |
| 4 | **Delegation grant** | A first-class, independently-revocable object that authorizes one principal to act on another's behalf. RFC 8693 `may_act`. Distinct from the trigger (what fires) and the audit record (proof it happened). |
| 5 | **Owner of record** | The human accountable for every non-human identity. Mandatory, never orphaned. |

### Vocabulary (fixed meanings)

- **Responsible principal:** the principal a unit of work is attributed to and bounded by. It is the only thing a trigger varies.
- **Owner:** the responsible principal recorded on a stored trigger (cron, hook, webhook, job). A human (`created_by`) or a service account (`runAs`).
- **App admin:** a principal holding `app:{id}:*`. Controls an app; independent from being an automation owner.
- **Run authority:** the exact permission set a single run executes under. Always an intersection.
- **Sensitive action:** an irreversible or high-impact action (bulk delete, external mail/messages, payments, granting access, production deploy).

### The One Principle

**No principal, no authority.** Every action is performed BY a named principal. There is no "system does it", no ambient privilege, no anonymous authority. If the platform cannot name who is responsible, the action is denied.

### Principals

Two identity classes: **human** and **non-human**. Identity (who it is) is governed separately from authority (what it may do). All three kinds share one permission engine.

| Kind | Class | What it is | Authenticates | Managed by |
|------|-------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Human | human | An individual person; the root of accountability | Password, OIDC, passkey (interactive) | Self or admin |
| Service account | non-human | A workload identity for deterministic automation that must outlive any individual | Client credentials (`rcs_...` key to short-lived token), M2M | Admin; always has a human owner of record |
| AI agent | non-human | An identity whose behaviour is **non-deterministic**: it reasons, picks tools dynamically | Platform spawns under a posed identity; or own credentials in autonomous mode | Auto-created at app deploy; always has a human owner of record |

**What distinguishes an agent from a service account is behaviour, not authority:**

| | Service Account | AI Agent |
|---|---|---|
| Behaviour | **Deterministic** (runs fixed code) | **Non-deterministic** (reasons, picks tools) |
| Authority operator | Own grant (REPLACE) | Intersection with responsible principal |
| May be a responsible principal? | Yes | Yes (in autonomous mode, governed identically to a SA) |
| Extra gate | None | **Supervision policy** (opt-in per-tool approval, because non-determinism = confused-deputy surface) |

**An agent is dual-mode.** Acting on a principal's behalf, its authority is the intersection. Acting autonomously (cron, hook, scheduled), it runs on its own grant ∩ task scope, governed exactly like a service account. Every chain, attended or not, terminates in an accountable human via the owner of record.

A **disabled** principal loses all authority instantly, on its very next request, job, or trigger. No path exempt; no waiting for token expiry.

### Apps and ownership

An **app** is the unit of work: data (tables), backend logic, an optional agent, crons, hooks, webhooks, jobs, secrets.

**Self-service:** any employee holding `platform:apps.create` can install an app and automatically becomes its **app admin** (`app:{id}:*`). The grant is over the new app only. It never confers platform authority and never lets the installer self-approve elevation to `admin:*` or `*`.

**Isolation is structural.** `app:A:*` cannot match `app:B:*` or `admin:*`. Each app's data lives in its own schema, gated by RLS.

### Permissions

A permission is a string `namespace:scope:action` (e.g. `app:crm:contacts.read`, `admin:apps.deploy`, `integration:gmail:send`).

- **Wildcards:** `app:crm:*` grants everything under `app:crm:`; the boundary is `:`, so it never leaks into `app:crm_secret:...`. The global `*` is platform super-admin.
- **Deny-by-default:** a principal starts with zero permissions.
- **Roles** carry permissions and may inherit other roles. Effective permissions = union of assigned roles.
- **Bounded granting:** you cannot grant a permission you do not yourself hold. Only `*` is unbounded.

### The Composition Law (the heart)

Every run executes under an **intersection**:

```
run authority = agent's own grant
              ∩ responsible principal's permissions  (omitted when autonomous)
              ∩ task scope
```

- When an agent acts on a principal's behalf, the responsible principal's permissions are an operand.
- When it acts autonomously (own credentials, like a SA), that operand drops out; the run is bounded by own grant ∩ task scope.
- **Empty intersection = zero authority.**
- **Task scope** is ephemeral: at invoke time the run is bound to specific entities and action classes. Default when unset = `app:{id}:*` (the automation's own app, narrowed by the owner intersection). A payload never widens scope. Expires with the run.
- **Down a chain, authority is monotone non-increasing.** A sub-invoke intersects against the parent's already-frozen set, never re-derived from the root. A cycle re-intersects a set already applied and gains nothing; depth is bounded (max 1 level of nesting).

---

## PART 2 — THE SCENARIO CATALOG

Every unit of work: **identify the responsible principal, compute the authority, pose it to the data layer.**

### Family A — Direct access (no agent)

- **A1 — A principal reads/writes its own app data** (human or SA, same path). RLS filters: read-deny = 0 rows (silent); write-deny = error.
- **A2 — App backend code touches data** (`ctx.sql` / `ctx.collection`). Runs under the current unit of work's identity, never a fresh or wider one. App code inherits a principal; it never selects one.
- **A3 — No identity in context.** No principal = deny-all. The app may run stateless logic but reaches no governed data.

### Family B — An agent run (the intersection)

The run executes under `agent ∩ responsible ∩ task scope`.

| Trigger | Responsible principal | `runAs` SA | Fire-time gate |
|---------|----------------------|:---:|----------------|
| Human clicks invoke | The user (live) | No | user holds `app:{id}:invoke` |
| Service account invokes (M2M) | The SA | n/a | SA holds `app:{id}:invoke` |
| Cron fires | The cron owner | Yes | owner present + enabled + holds `invoke` |
| Hook fires (data change) | The hook owner | Yes | same |
| Webhook arrives | The webhook owner | Yes | same + authentic payload (Family H) |
| Job runs (one-shot) | The job owner | Yes | same |
| Channel message (Slack/Telegram) | The linked user | No | linked + enabled + holds `invoke` + authentic (Family H) |

Channel is an authenticated transport, equivalent to the app UI. The linked user is the responsible principal directly, same as a click.

- **B1 — The owned-automation gate.** Cron, hook, webhook, and job obey one gate: *owner present AND enabled AND holds `app:{id}:invoke`*, else **refused, fail-closed**. An owner stripped of invoke, disabled, or deleted stops firing immediately.
- **B1b — Consent is a delegation grant (RFC 8693 `may_act`).** When a trigger is created, a delegation grant captures the consent. The trigger *references* the grant. Revoking the grant immediately disables every trigger that references it without deleting them. The audit log records each exercise (`act`) but is never the authorization (`may_act`).
- **B2 — A user click carries no stored owner.** The human is present directly as the responsible principal; it cannot be `runAs` a service account.
- **B3 — Channel messages are attended.** The linked user is the responsible principal directly (same as a UI click). The channel is an authenticated transport (HMAC-verified, identity linked); it carries the same trust level as the app's own UI.
- **B4 — Task scope applies.** Default = `app:{id}:*` (full app, narrowed by owner intersection). A payload never widens authority.

### Family C — Composition (chains and cross-app)

- **C1 — Sub-invoke.** An agent invokes another. The hop is gated against the **parent's frozen set** (`app:{target}:invoke` must be inside it). The child runs at `child_agent ∩ effective(parent) ∩ child_scope`. Authority narrows against the parent, never re-widens against the root.
- **C2 — Deep chains and cycles.** Each hop is a subset. A cycle re-intersects and gains nothing. Depth is bounded (currently max 1 level of sub-invocation).
- **C3 — Cross-app data.** RLS filters each app's schema per-principal; unauthorized schemas return 0 rows.
- **C4 — Cross-app action call.** The frozen intersection is carried to the target.

### Family D — The agent's tools

| Tool | Effect | Bound by |
|------|--------|----------|
| Read / write data | Governed query | RLS under the run authority |
| Call an integration | Outbound action | The responsible principal's own connected credential, audience-restricted. No connection = denied. |
| Call another app's action | Cross-app hop | C4 |
| Invoke another agent | Sub-invoke | C1 |

### Family E — Granting and ownership

Every way new authority is created is capped at the actor's own authority.

- **E1 — Grant a role.** Bounded granting: cannot assign a permission you do not hold. Only `*` is unbounded.
- **E2 — Create automation `runAs` a service account.**
  - **Default: subset-by-construction.** If `perms(SA) ⊆ perms(creator)`, no extra grant needed. Most automation lives here.
  - **Above subset: one act-as grant.** A narrow, explicit, SA-specific, revocable, audited delegation grant, fenced by: **no one may issue act-as on an identity more privileged than the granting authority's own.** This keeps the capability GCP/AWS deliberately keep (`actAs`/`PassRole`) while closing the unscoped escalation vector (a well-documented cloud privilege-escalation path). [Tenable, Rhino Security Labs]
  - **No standing escalate-override permission.** No `admin:rbac.escalate` as a permanent grant. The anti-escalation fence (no one may grant act-as on an identity more privileged than their own) structurally prevents this case.
- **E3 — Install an app.** The installer auto-receives `app:{id}:*` over the new app only (self-service), never platform authority.

### Family F — Sensitive actions and the confused-deputy boundary

The intersection bounds the maximum. It does not stop an agent from being *steered* by malicious input into a harmful action within that maximum. A **supervision policy** (per-app, configurable) gates tool calls that the app admin designates as sensitive.

- **F1 — Supervision modes.** `autonomous` (all tools allowed within run authority), `supervised` (designated tools require human approval before execution). Default is autonomous; app admins opt-in to supervision per tool or tool category.
- **F2 — Approval flow.** When a supervised tool is called, execution pauses and an `ApprovalRequired` event is raised. The responsible principal (or a designated approver) confirms or denies. Denied = tool call refused, agent continues with remaining tools.

All app data, integration payloads, and channel content are **untrusted input**: may inform reasoning, never the sole source of authority.

### Family G — Lifecycle

- **G1 — Disable a principal.** Instant deny on next request/job/trigger. No path exempt.
- **G2 — Delete a human owner.** Directly-owned automation becomes ownerless and is refused. Directly-owned automation is meant to stop when its owner is gone.
- **G3 — Disable/delete a service account.** Kill switch for everything it owns.
- **G4 — Offboard owner of record.** A non-human identity (agent or SA) is never left ownerless. Ownership must be re-assigned; an ownerless identity is refused. [OWASP NHI1]
- **G5 — Revoke/expire a credential.** Instant and permanent. Multiple active credentials for zero-downtime rotation.
- **G6 — Revoke a role / reduce permissions.** Drops on next request, including for any automation that principal owns.

### Family H — Authenticity

External events must be proven authentic before any owner's authority is touched.

- **H1 — Inbound webhooks:** signature over raw body + timestamp, short freshness window; replayed/altered payloads dropped. Secret stored as irreversible hash.
- **H2 — Channel messages:** verified against the platform's signing secret before the linked user is resolved.
- **H3 — Crons and jobs:** authentic by origin (the scheduler itself).

A payload never carries authority. It can only activate an authority the owner already holds.

## PART 3 — THE DELEGATION MATRIX

Every ordered pair among {human, agent, service account}. Authority always narrows or stays equal; no transition widens.

| Initiator → Runs-as | Verdict | Authority | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Human → Human** | Forbidden | -- | No human runs as another (non-repudiation) |
| **Human → Agent** | Permitted | `agent ∩ human ∩ scope` | `app:{id}:invoke` |
| **Human → SA** | Guarded | `SA ∩ scope` (REPLACE) | Act-as grant + subset fence (E2) |
| **Agent → Human** | Forbidden | -- | Authority never re-mounts |
| **Agent → Agent** | Guarded | `child ∩ effective(parent) ∩ child_scope` | `invoke` in frozen parent; depth bound; no-cycle |
| **Agent → SA** | Forbidden (default) | -- | Non-deterministic actor cannot escape intersection clamp via REPLACE |
| **SA → Human** | Forbidden | -- | Machine never runs as human |
| **SA → Agent** | Permitted | `agent ∩ SA ∩ scope` | SA holds `invoke`. This is the "autonomous agent". |
| **SA → SA** | Guarded | `SA_target ∩ scope` (REPLACE) | Human-created act-as grant, subset-fenced, depth 1 max, recertified |

**Structural invariants on the matrix:**
- Only **human** and **service account** can be a responsible principal at the root of a chain.
- An **agent** may be its own responsible principal in autonomous mode (governed like a SA, with owner of record).
- A delegation grant's target is always non-human. No edge ever targets a human.
- Per-principal worker isolation makes each cell's identity fixed at spawn.

---

## PART 4 — STRUCTURAL ENFORCEMENT

The permission engine is not the only line. Even if bypassed, independent layers hold:

1. **Process sandbox.** The app has no database credentials, no identity token, no filesystem access. It communicates only through the brokered channel.
2. **Restricted execution role.** The app's SQL runs as a non-owner role: no DDL, no `set_config`, no system schemas.
3. **Row-Level Security.** Every table has FORCE RLS. The core poses identity for a single transaction, below the app's reach.

**Per-principal worker isolation.** Each distinct identity runs in its own worker process, bound for life to the identity it was spawned for. One identity's run can never act as another's.

---

## PART 5 — CREDENTIAL LIFECYCLE (SERVICE ACCOUNTS)

- **Format:** typed prefix `rcs_` + 256-bit random secret. Shown once; stored as irreversible hash (SHA-256), looked up by indexed prefix then constant-time compare.
- **Expiry:** mandatory, configurable (default 90 days). Expired = denied.
- **Rotation:** multiple active credentials per SA for zero-downtime. Roll new in, revoke old.
- **Revocation:** instant and permanent (G5).
- **Disable:** instant kill switch for the SA and everything it owns (G3).
- **Authentication:** client credentials exchanged for a short-lived bearer token (no refresh token, RFC 6749 section 4.4). The token carries the SA as subject.
- **No interactive login:** all human login paths (password/OIDC/magic-link) create human identities only. A SA has no password, no OIDC sub, no magic-link.

---

## PART 6 — AUDIT

The audit log is the backbone of named accountability.

- Every record carries: **who acted** (the actor), **who authorized** (the responsible principal / delegator), the trigger reference, the action, the target entity, and a timestamp.
- Records are **append-only** for every principal including `*`: the `audit_log` table has no UPDATE/DELETE permissions for app roles. Only INSERT via trigger functions.
- Records are set via GUCs (`rootcx.user_id`, `rootcx.delegator_uid`, `rootcx.trigger_ref`) posed by the core before each transaction, below the app's reach.

---

## PART 7 — INVARIANTS (what is always true)

1. **No principal = denied.** Every unit of work names a responsible principal or it does not run.
2. **Disabled = denied instantly.** No path exempt; never waits for token expiry.
3. **A run never exceeds `agent ∩ responsible principal ∩ task scope`.** Empty intersection = zero authority.
4. **Authority is monotone non-increasing down a chain.** A child never regains what a parent dropped; a cycle gains nothing; depth is bounded (max 1).
5. **Owned automation with a disabled, non-invoking, or absent owner is refused.** Consent is a first-class grant: revoking it disables referencing triggers without deleting them.
6. **You cannot grant authority beyond what you hold.** `runAs` is subset-by-default; exceeding it requires a narrow, fenced act-as grant. No standing escalate-override.
7. **Every non-human identity has a human owner of record.** An ownerless identity is refused; offboarding reassigns. Every chain terminates in an accountable human.
8. **An agent is dual-mode.** Its authority is always bounded: intersection when acting for another, own grant when autonomous.
9. **Supervision gates sensitive tool calls** when the app admin enables it (per-tool or per-category).
10. **Untrusted input informs but never authorizes.** A payload never carries authority.
11. **External events are authenticated before any principal is reached.**
12. **Integration credentials run as their connected principal**, audience-restricted, never borrowed.
13. **App code cannot forge, override, or read the identity context.**
14. **`app:A:*` never matches `app:B:*` or `admin:*`.** App isolation is structural.
15. **Every action is recorded with who acted and who authorized.** Append-only.

## PART 9 — ROADMAP (not yet implemented)

The following are design goals for future iterations. They are NOT enforced today.

| Item | What it would add | Blocked by |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| Per-trigger task scope | Each cron/hook/webhook declares exactly which permissions it needs (instead of `app:*`) | Needs manifest schema + migration |
| Configurable depth ceiling | Per-root configurable nesting depth with per-hop decrement | No use case yet (depth=1 suffices) |
| Break-glass procedure | Time-boxed, dual-authorized, auto-expiring super-admin SA creation | Needs UX design + dual-auth flow |
| Hash-chained audit | Tamper-evident audit log (SHA-256 chain linking records) | Needs external sink + retention policy |
| Mandatory supervision | Sensitive actions deny-by-default even when supervision is not explicitly configured | Needs "sensitive action" classification per tool |
